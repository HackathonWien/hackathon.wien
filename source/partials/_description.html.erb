      <p>
        Refugee Hack is a 2 days and 1 evening contest where developers, graphic/web/UX designers and projectmanagers come together and build software to help refugees in Austria either directly or indirectly. We will define concrete project outline before the start, so that we can focus completely on building something great and useful.

      <p>
        The 1. Refugee Hack Vienna will be part of an european Code week, that takes place at the same time in many european cities.
  Depending on how many participants there will be, we will split up the participants in teams of around 20 people to different co-working spaces in Vienna. Every team will work on one project and at the end the jury will choose a winner.

        You don't have to be involved in refugee help projects and know the problems. We are exploring all options right now and will have a very good outline of what the solution should be, by the time you will start.
        We are thankful for all ideas, how a technical solution can help refugees directly or indirecty (by helping organize the help). Contact us at team@hackathons.wien or on facebook.
