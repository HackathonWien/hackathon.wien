Refugee Hack Vienna was a 2 days and 1 evening contest, where developers,
graphic/web/UX designers and project managers came together to build software
to help refugees in Austria either directly or indirectly by helping organisations
optimize their work.

## The Motivation

At a meetup to plan the second Foodhack Vienna, we realized it would make more
sense in the current refugee crises to host a Refugee Hackathon. So they idea
was born in our mind and we dived right into researching the status quo and
coming up with possible app-solutions, that would actually have a potential
impact. We wanted to help with our expertises. And we thought if we want to,
probably many other people in Vienna would also like to help in that way.
And we were right to think so...
